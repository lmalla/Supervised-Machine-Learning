Considering the Models -
For unscaled dataset I am assuming Random Forest Classifier will perform better than logistic regression model because
Random Forest Classifier is more of Accuracy focused algorithm and can capture more complex feature patterns to provide
the best accuracy. On the other side logistic regression model doesn't give you discrete output and gives Probability 
associated with each output.

Evaluating the Models -
With unscaled dataset the Random Forest Classifier model performed better than logistic regression model as expected.

Results w/ Scaling - 
Once I scaled the data, the logistic regression became the better classifier. It had an accuracy score of .65.  
The Random Forest model decreased in accuracy from .64 to .5. This could be because of scaled data as logistic
regression is calculation based hence better score.

Final thoughts -
As the best score came out of these models is .65 I won't be recommending this ML model for predictions.
